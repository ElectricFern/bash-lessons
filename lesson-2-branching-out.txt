Title: Lesson 2 Branching Out


Basic Overview of lesson:

In this lesson we are going to repeat what we learnt in lesson 1 but using a different structure and visualization.
Using Trees!
This time we are going to make a project base directory called trunk and make some directories off it called big-branch-1 to big-branch-4
Each big-branch will have two small-branch and each small-branch will have ten leaf-n.txt files in it where n is between 1-10.
Make some insect.txt files and move them around the branches
Add and remove branches (directories), leaves and insects (files) from the tree.

New commands!

less : use to view the contents of a file with a specified name
head/tails : use to see the first ten lines of a file printed out in the command window
pwd: Displays the name of the working directory
history: Displays a list of the last commands you have run
help : Using help followed by a command lists what the command is capable of. For a shorter description use 'help -d'.
cal : brings up a calendar. 
date : brings up the current date and time.
